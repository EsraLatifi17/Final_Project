MeowTopia

A web project dedicated to cat lovers, offers a sleek design and user-friendly sections for Home, Services, Projects, About, Blog, and Contact, all using nothing but the frontend trilogy - HTML, CSS, JS. Feel free to explore and contribute.

Future Plans
This is just the beginning! My goal is to add lots of other features and layers to the page and hopefully in the near future, Ill get it to be fullstack and fully functional, like for example interactive cat features, integration for cat adoptions, or a cat lover community forum, being able to handle donations and many others.

Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Fork the project and let's make Cat Lovers' Haven even more purr-fect.
